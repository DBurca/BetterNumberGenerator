# BetterNumberGenerator
 A better number generator built for a small school project. Made in Construct 3.

## Elimination Mode:
 Elimination Mode is a function that "eliminates" numbers as they are rolled.
 This prevents the same number from being rolled twice until the reset button is pressed.

## Helpful tips:

* Touchscreen users: If the buttons don't seem to register taps, click the button in the upper left corner labled "Input mode".
This will optimize the program for touchscreen devices.

* Currently, this number generator only generates whole numbers.

### Changelog:
* 5/7 - Project initialized
* 5/8 - Touchscreen support added
* 5/9 - Touchscreen bug fixed
* 5/10 - Minor Aesthetic improvements
